# Projects Overview

**UNIX/Python Tutorial**
This short UNIX/Python tutorial introduces students to the Python
programming language and the UNIX environment.

**Search**
Implemented depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search
algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling
salesman problems in the Pacman world.

**Multi-Agent Search**
Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search
problem. Students implement multiagent minimax and expectimax
algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.

**Reinforcement Learning**
Implemented model-based and model-free reinforcement learning
algorithms, applied to the AIMA textbook's Gridworld, Pacman, and a
simulated crawling robot.

**Ghostbusters**
Probabilistic inference in a hidden Markov model tracks the movement of
hidden ghosts in the Pacman world. Students implement exact inference
using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters.

**Classification**
Implemented standard machine learning classification algorithms using
Naive Bayes, Perceptron, and MIRA models to classify digits. Students


extend this by implementing a behavioral cloning Pacman agent.

**Contest: Pacman Capture the Flag**
Created strategies for a team of two agents to play a multi-player capture-
the-flag variant of Pacman.

# Technical Notes

The Pac-Man projects are written in pure Python 2.7 and do not depend on
any packages external to a standard Python distribution.
